# Message Templates - Evidence-aware messaging
messages:
  high_confidence:

    examples: 
      - "Instead of 'grep the file', write 'use the grep command' or 'search the file with grep'"

    template: "Consider using proper command syntax for '{command}' instead of using it as a verb."
    examples:

    template: "'{command}' may benefit from more precise command syntax for technical clarity."
    examples:
      - "This is a minor suggestion for technical consistency"

# Suggestions - Evidence-aware suggestions
suggestions:
  high_confidence:
    - "Use proper command syntax: 'Use the {command} command to...'"

  medium_confidence:
    - "Consider using: 'the {command} command'"
    - "Technical writing benefits from precise command terminology"
